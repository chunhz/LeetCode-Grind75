/*
  Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a positive
  integer <span>k</span> and returns the kth largest integer contained in the
  BST.
</p>
<p>
  You can assume that there will only be integer values in the BST and that
  <span>k</span> is less than or equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
</p>
<p>
  Also, for the purpose of this question, duplicate integers will be treated as
  distinct values. In other words, the second largest value in a BST containing
  values <span>{5, 7, 7}</span> will be <span>7</span>â€”not <span>5</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Each <span>BST</span> node has an integer <span>value</span>, a
  <span>left</span> child node, and a <span>right</span> child node. A node is
  said to be a valid <span>BST</span> node if and only if it satisfies the BST
  property: its <span>value</span> is strictly greater than the values of every
  node to its left; its <span>value</span> is less than or equal to the values
  of every node to its right; and its children nodes are either valid
  <span>BST</span> nodes themselves or <span>None</span> / <span>null</span>.
</p>
